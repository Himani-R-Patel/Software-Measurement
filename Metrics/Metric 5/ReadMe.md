Software maintenance involves modification of the product to fix the bugs. 
This plays an important role in a way that software does not age. 
Maintainability is defined as the difficulty of changing a software system’s source code, thus it is tied very closely to the concept of software maintenance. 
Maintainability Index was first proposed by Oman and Hagemeister and derived a formula of their own. 
This formula was modified and used in programs like Microsoft visual studio. After a lot of changes the final formula resulted:

MI = 171-5.2*ln(V) -0.23*(G) -16.2*ln (LOC)

Where the independent variables are 
V- Halstead Volume
G- Cyclomatic complexity
LOC- Source lines of code (SLOC). 

According to the formula if the maintainability index is greater than 45 indicates a class or a project indicates good maintainability. If it is less than 45 then it requires high maintenance. 
The individual parameters Halsted volume, cyclomatic complexity and SLOC involves changes in overall value. 
Halsted volume involves the number of operators and operands, if there is an increase in these values results in increase of Halstead volume which in turn decreases maintainability index that requires high maintenance. 
Similarly, higher the cyclomatic complexity involves higher the control predicates that results in less maintainability index.
Calculating Maintainability Index
Tools used: Prest and Sci-tools
We have taken five different projects and calculated the maintainability index for each class and then found the average of all the classes to get the maintainability index of individual projects and their versions.
In order to calculate the Maintainability index, we have used Prest jar file to calculate Halstead volume. 
PREST is easy to use as it just takes the input files and parse the results as methods, classes and packages. From these we took the class results. 
In order to calculate Cyclomatic complexity and source lines of code we used Sci-tools which takes all the project files and analyzes the data. 
The export metric provides an option to choose the required metric values that can be parsed in form of a csv file. 
The results from both the files are combined in a common Excel file and a macro was written using maintainability index formula to get the maintainability index for each class. 
The Maintainability Index of a project was calculated by taking the average of all the classes.
