Testing is an internal part of software development process used to improve the quality of software. It is crucial to improve software tests because of increase in size and complexity of software. However, it is often difficult to do a complete testing as there are incompatibilities between the cost of testing and the number of faults it detects. Quality of a test suite often measures testing effectiveness. A test suite detecting more bugs directly implies the quality of that test suite.
One of the ways to measure the quality of test suite is through Mutation Testing. It initiates spurious defects to measure the quality of test suite. Mutation introduces defects by modifying a small piece of code that should result in an abnormal behavior when tests are run. If the tests fail, it can be inferred that some tests are not checking every possible behavior. So those tests need to be improved. Developers need to design new tests that can distinguish the behavior of mutants from the original program. There are two well-known tools available to calculate mutation score i.e Stryker and PIT testing. For our projects, we have chosen PIT, a practical mutation PIT testing tool for Java.
