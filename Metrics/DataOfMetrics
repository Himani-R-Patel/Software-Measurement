Metric wise analysis of projects which include .Xlsx and .csv files.

Metric 3: Test Suite Effectiveness
We generated PIT reports as csv files for all projects. Analyzing the data, we found that Line Coverage is calculated based on mutated line of code. If one test case does not execute mutated line, then that line is not considered in line coverage. PIT report also provides total no. of test cases, line coverage and mutation coverage considering the master suite of project. It is calculated by taking average of line and mutation coverage of all test suites. We found that line coverage and mutation coverage are independent of no. of test cases in test suites. They depend on quality of test case based on mutants killed. According to our analysis, line coverage and mutation score for all test suites in all projects are following moderate linearity.
