The post-release Defect Density is a metric which we can compare across the different versions of the projects as well as various projects. The post-release Defect Density is basically used to indicate the Product Quality. The total number of source lines of code are used by the calculation of the post-release Defect Density. 
A formula to measure Defect Density:

Defect Density = Defect count/size of the release(SLOC)

•  Defect Count is the total number of post-release defects
•  SLOC are the total number of  source lines of code

Here, there are 3 folders as follows.

No of Defects : This records the total number of defects that we have found for the each 6 version of each project.There is one excel file for each project having the 6 sheets for each version in it.
SLOC : This records the total source line of code for the each 6 version of each project.There is one excel file for each project having the 6 sheets for each version in it.
Post Release Defect Density :This folder contains the 6 files of calculated Post-Release Defect Density value for the each project
